# Data Scientist in Practice

Welcome to my first data science project. It is part of the Data Scientist in Practice Marathon 3.0, from the YouTube portuguese channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd3ThZLzVDDnKSZMsbK0icg.
The marathon happened on 22th, 24th, 26th and 29th of March 2021. The teacher, Eduardo, shared the data and the code with comments, as well as video classes teaching how the code works. 

The goal was to build a machine to predict if a loan is approved or not to be used by employees in credit loaning companies. The data provided by the teacher consists in 614 clients and their information, e.g. marital status, income, number of children, how much they wanted to loan and if that loan was approved or not.

Check below for the statistics and my analysis!

## My experience during the project

At the time of the marathon, I was enrolled in TechLabs' Data Science course, so I already had basic knowledge of data science; the marathon helped me put all I learned into practice. I also learned a lot about machine learning, which I found easier than expected! I was able to use the base code, which was very good, and edit it as I pleased. The data and comments was originally in portuguese, I changed the NaN removal algorithms, improved the graphics. 

## Technologies used

The code was written in Python using Google Colabs.
The graphics were built using seaborn and matplotlib. 
The machine learning was built using sklearn and RandomForestClassifier.
The WEB system used HTML to set the font and colors.

The URL is an ngrok.io type. As it expires in some time, here is some screenshots to show the system works.
